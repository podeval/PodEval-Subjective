      name: Welcome to the <span class="highlight">podcast dialogue naturalness evaluation</span>!
      content: <p></p>
        <span class="content-header">Task Description:</span> 
        <p> In this test, you will listen to podcast dialogue segments generated by different systems. Your task is to evaluate the <span class="highlight">naturalness</span> of the dialogue in each segment on a scale from <span class="highlight">0 to 100</span>.</p>
        <span class="content-header">Evaluation Criteria:</span>
        <ul>
        <li> <span class="highlight">0 – 20 (Bad):</span> The dialogue is completely unnatural, robotic, or awkward. It does not resemble a real conversation.</li>
        <li> <span class="highlight">20 - 40 (Poor):</span> The dialogue has significant unnaturalness, with multiple awkward phrases, robotic tones, or inconsistent flows.</li>
        <li> <span class="highlight">40 - 60 (Fair):</span> The dialogue is somewhat natural but has noticeable issues. It may feel rehearsed or lack smooth transitions. </li>
        <li> <span class="highlight">60 - 80 (Good):</span> The dialogue is mostly natural, with minor unnatural elements. It resembles a real conversation but could still be improved. </li>
        <li> <span class="highlight">80 - 100  (Excellent):</span> The dialogue sounds completely natural, like a real, spontaneous conversation between people. </li>
        </ul>
        <span class="content-header">Important Notes:</span>
        <ul>
        <li>The content of the dialogues may differ across systems. Please focus on the <span class="highlight">overall naturalness</span> of the dialogue rather than the specific content or details (e.g., timbre, accent, noise or cut-off effects)</li>
        <li>In other words, <span class="highlight">how realistic and similar are these dialogue segments to real podcast conversations?</span></li>
        <li>Each test group includes a <span class="highlight">Reference</span> audio extracted from a real podcast episode, representing the "<span class="highlight">Excellent</span>" level of naturalness. This reference is provided to help calibrate your scoring.</li>
        <li>You can replay the audio segments as many times as you wish before assigning a score.</li>
        <li>Use headphones in a quiet environment for the best experience.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Your feedback is valuable. Thank you for participating!</p>
